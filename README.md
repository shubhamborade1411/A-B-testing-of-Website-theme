# A-B-testing-of-Website-theme

- To understand which theme is better, the company can set a light theme as the default theme of the website for a certain period and collect data on how users interact with the website. Likewise, they can set a dark theme as the default theme for the same period and compare the user interaction data of both themes to find which theme resulted in better user interaction, purchases, signups, longer session duration, and more.

- So for the task of A/B testing of themes, we need to have a dataset of user interaction data on two themes or design templates.
